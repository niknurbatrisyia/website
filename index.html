  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Assalamualaikum & Hello! Welcome to Tisyia's Safe Space, a simple site where you hopefully get to know me more. To keep it simple, my name is Nik Nur Batrisyia Binti Nik Mohd Izani. I was born on the 27th of November 2001 in Selangor. To be specific, I was born at Hospital Selayang. I live in Gombak, Selangor with my family for about fourteen years. I am the first child out of two siblings and I have a brother. Therefore, I need to show a good behaviour to ensure that my brother will follow my steps too. I am currently in my last semester of studying at Universiti Teknologi MARA Cawangan Negeri Sembilan Kampus Rembau in Diploma of Information Management. My favourite thing to do when I am free is watching netflix, a platform where you can watch variety of shows and listening to good music on spotify, an application that allows you to play msuic. My favourite artist at the moment is Alina Baraz, a R&B singer from America. As for my personality, I am actually an ambivert person which means that I have both qualities of an extroverted and introverted person. To describe it briefly, I am not shy around strangers but I would not hit them up first for meaningless conversation unless if it is really needed. While that being said, I only have small group of friends that I trust and really close with. Some of them were from primary school and some of them were the people that I met in university. I truly appreciate them all and I wish that we can maintain our friendship forever. Apart from that, I am also someone that loves nature and be in nature. My morning routine included walking around my neighbourhood to enjoy the nature. Other than that, there is also one person that I would like to highlight, the person that I really cherished and he always motivated me to become a better daughter, partner, friend and overall a better person in this society. Life would be different without him and I am eternally grateful that I get to know him. </p>

  <h1>Hobbies 💜</h1>
  <p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 16px; "> My favourite past time is watching netflix shows and listening to music on Spotify. The shows that I watched include shows such as dramas, movies, documentary shows and reality shows. As for the music, I listened to all kind of music. I do not have any specific taste on the genre. To me, I will listen to any songs as long as it is good for me to hear. I do not limit myself to certain genre, but instead I let myself be open minded and allow myself to explore more various things. I also enjoy singing along to the music when I do my assignments or when I try to take a nap. But to be specific, my favourite artist of all time will definitely be Alina Baraz, a female R&B singer from America. The picture that I showed on the right, is my Spotify account or my profile.

<h2>Partner 💜</h2>
<p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 16px; "> I love going out with my partner. We lives far away from each other but he always try to spend his time to take me out. We will usually do fun activities such as food hunting at new places, going to art gallery around Kuala Lumpur as well as doing physcial activities such as riding a boat, riding a bicycle and kayaking. I love to discover new activities with him because it will allow us to create as many memories as we can. Other than that, he is always supportive of everything that I did. We have been together for about three years and 2022 will mark our four years together. I am eternally grateful for him and I truly hope that we can tie the knot as soon as I am finished with my studies.

      <h3>💕My Close Friends💕</h3>
      <p>I truly wish for every woman to find themselves a group of sisters, that would support them in every steps of their life. Being in a sisterhood is really special and important especially when you are getting older. They are the people that will cry with you and help you through your downs and they are the one that will celebrate your achievements. Friends are as significant as a family because it is so rare to find good souls that you could connect with immediately. This is a picture of my friends. I am glad that I found them and I thank God for giving me chances to meet my people. I do not want to lose them and I hope they all the best in their journeys. I wanted them to know that I am always here to assist them through everything and I hope to celebrate their joys too. I really hope that our friendship will last until jannah inshaAllah ❤. </p>

          <p>This is my small and humble family. Family is where life begins and love never ends. There are four of us in total. My parents got married at 28 and 25 years old after three years of friendship. Their wedding anniversary is on 31st of August. Hence, they have been married for about 21 years. My parents met at Kuala Lumpur, specifically at the apartment in Kampung Baru where they both rent different units together with their other friends. To me, family is really important because they are the one that you are going to spend much time with. I truly love my small family so much. </p>

My father was born in Kelantan but when he was five years old, his family moved to Jengka, Pahang. To describe my father, he is very loving and funny. He shows his love by spending money on things that we want. My father is not wealthy, but he tried to fulfill our desires and needs. I do appreciate my father a lot. I really hope that I can repay his efforts to make him happy as he had done to us before.</p>

I love to capture every single things that happens in my life including pictures of my family, my partner, my small circles of friends and things that I love. I appreciate every single people and memories that are in my life right now. For me, the best things in life are not things, they are moments. Aside from my people, I also love taking picture of foods, skies, cats and arts. Most of them were captured while I do my routine such as taking a walk in the morning, going on dates on weekend and spending time with my family. These are some memorable pictures of things that I captured and I absolutely loved and it sometimes include my family, partner and friends that I would like to keep forever, in my memory and heart 💕.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black;"> Among the experiences that I have been through in my life, there is one that I could not forget about, it is when I got the chance to perform Umrah with my family in December 2018 after my examination. It is genuinely one of the most life-changing and eye-opening experience I have ever had. I am grateful for my parents because they worked really hard to afford our whole family to Saudi Arabia. I truly hope that we could go there again one day. May Allah S.W.T invite us to be His guests again, InshaAllah.
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: black;">Apart from that, my experience in terms of working aspect is that I once worked as a cashier at Galeri Ariani in Jakel Mall, Kuala Lumpur. I started working in April 2019 and I quit in July because I need to further my study in UiTM. There are many lessons that I could learn from working there such as we have to always be humble, we have to be honest when we work and we have to be efficient while working. I am grateful that I made new friends and still keep in touch with some people there.
